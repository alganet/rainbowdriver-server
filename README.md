# Rainbow Driver

RainbowDriver is an attempt to implement the Selenium JSON Wire Protocol for
WinJS / Windows 8 applications (formerly known as Metro).

The project is very early stages, but we plan to grow fast.

Help is appreciated, specially with documentation. Reach us out in the issues or via email.

#Rainbow Driver Server [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/rainbowdriver/rainbowdriver-server.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rainbowdriver/rainbowdriver-server)

Server component of the Rainbow Driver family.

Your application must include the rainbowdriver-client library which to connect to the
rainbowdriver-server. We are automating this process in rainbowdriver-node.
